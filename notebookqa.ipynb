What I did was using similarity index using BERT large language model and compare student answer with teacher sample answer in terms of their cosine similarity useing sklearn. Seconr project, was about image processing. We have 55000 image with bbox and segmentation, and we trained decetron object detection model, to get ingridient of a food based on an image. It was successful in terms of ingredient, there were some issue like whether the tomato in food is cooked or raw etc. It was important because the aim of the project was to predict the nutrition fact of the food. And thirs project, was about finance. I make a pipeline in azure to gather tick data from stock exchange api, and I made some function to evaluate the impact of asia during 22:00 till 8:00 on commodity price in london and new york based like Nasdaq.  It was a successful project in terms of providing information, prediction was plausible as it had around 70% accurate winning trade suggestion, however defining the stop loss, was important but tey wanted to do it manually.\"\n",

First, they were not in same interval, also BERT model does not consider a context, then evaluate similarity of two expression. Therefore, from BERT model, the similarity of student answer and teacher sample answer were much higher than teacher grade after normalizing both intervals. What I did was finding the best way to map teacher grade to BERT index, to make it more meaningful. Considering the minimum grade be teacher and mapping to a better interval. The result was plausible. For making even better tuned, after each train, the reverse map also needed some small amendment. \n",

And after that I made a column to say when a breakout happened. Also I created a column that showd past breakout situation. Then I made a function that does a trade with x time interval to say if a trade happens in breakout what would be the result. In histogram kde, I reached to a probability distribution of trading close time. I did the same based on price. At the end both gives user the probability of having a suitable closing time, based on both function. Eventually I used rnn to make a simple prediction to compare both trading suggestion.\"\n",

A surprising fact, was indeed the confirmation of a known approach in the market, that at the beggining I thought it will not work. By visualizing the price interval of 12 important markets (e.g. which are open from 10:30-13:30, 13:30-16:30 etc) I reached to the conclusion that time is not flat in the market and it is very sensitive to its distance to the openning of a new stock market. E.g. Another conclusion was to have a decision tree for trading, and it is better to make it more reliable based on times that events happends, like declairing a decision. Indeed my project, was only a help to facilitate the time consuming process of claculating and working on the visualization. It only give signal, and the decision is by user. However based on data, it increase around 5% per month, however I did not considered the commition from brooker. Overal it was plausible.\"\n",
